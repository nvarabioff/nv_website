Run Locally:
- npm start
- to exit, close browser tab and Ctrl+C in terminal

Deploy to github:
 - npm run deploy - this deploys to the master branch
 - **Important: you have to go to settings and change the domain name - create a CNAME - because every deployment overwrites the existing CNAME

Files from Google Drive:
 - Right click item, click "get sharable link"
 - Replace "open" with "uc"
 - For Resume, can just drag and drop new version to folder on drive. A popup window should open saying they "match"
    - Just click "replace" and the file will update, no need to make changes to drive link on website code

GIT Changes:
 - git status -> shows changed files
 - git add . -> Adds (all of the modified files) to staging area
 - git commit -m "<message>" -> commits the modified files
